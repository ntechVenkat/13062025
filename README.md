1.Here we have the two React hooks used for the performance optimization of our React project.Those useMemo and useCallback  
2.useMemo based on te dependency, It will memoize the result of the function which is argument to the useMemo hook  
3.useCallback based on the dependency, It will memoize the function reference which is argument to the useCallback hook  

In our file I have written the code for without & with useMemo, useCallback respectively, We can see the difference of by commenting & uncommenting of appropriate hook  
As usual we can see the visual result in the folder of Results.
